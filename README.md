# Chores Manager
Created for my little brother's use, this application is used to track and record the amount of chores that siblings do each day with the end goal being a monetary prize. It displays the total capital earned from doing chores along with how much each sibling earned according to how much work they have done on average (percentage wise). This application is more so for guiding a younger sibling to learn household skills, encouraging them to slowly learn more and to be able to do the majority of the work for a specific task. In this case, this application is mainly focused on washing dishes and cleaning up after meals (although you can use it for whatever you like).

## Usage
Chores Manager allows up to two users to be tracked. Users can submit a report for each day specifying the amount of work each person has done (in percent %). Values will automatically update when reports are received and are rounded according to the data type. The application has beeen developed such that once reports are submitted, they can neither be changed nor deleted, encouraging communication between users prior to submitting a report together. Honesty and trust is very important between siblings which is why no profiles nore password fields were included during the development stage of the application.

Settings are available to change:
 - Both user's names
 - The monetary amount received at the end
 - The number of days users must work for

There is an option to **reset all data**, changing all values back to the default value and removing all reports. This will allow users to restart from the beginning once the current run is over.
